# üõ†Ô∏è Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development and IT operations teams.

- **Dev** = Software Development
- **Ops** = IT Operations
- Goal: Deliver applications and services at high velocity

## Key Benefits

- Faster time to market
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Increased deployment frequency
- Reduced failure rate of new releases
- Faster recovery time in case of failure

## Traditional vs DevOps Approach

| Aspect                | Traditional IT | DevOps               |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Development & Ops     | Siloed         | Collaborative        |
| Deployments           | Manual         | Automated (CI/CD)    |
| Feedback Cycle        | Slow           | Fast                 |
| Infrastructure Mgmt   | Manual setup   | IaC (e.g., Terraform)|
| Monitoring            | Reactive       | Proactive            |

## DevOps Lifecycle Phases

1. **Plan** ‚Äì Requirements and planning (Agile, Jira, etc.)
2. **Develop** ‚Äì Code development (Git, GitHub)
3. **Build** ‚Äì Compilation and build (Maven, Gradle)
4. **Test** ‚Äì Automated testing (JUnit, Selenium)
5. **Release** ‚Äì Versioning and approval
6. **Deploy** ‚Äì Automated deployment (CI/CD tools like Jenkins)
7. **Operate** ‚Äì Infrastructure and system administration (Docker, K8s)
8. **Monitor** ‚Äì Continuous feedback (Prometheus, ELK Stack)

## Core DevOps Tools (by Category)

- **Source Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- **Containers**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

---

## DevOps Culture

- **Collaboration**: Shared responsibilities between Dev and Ops
- **Automation**: Everything from testing to deployment
- **Measurement**: Metrics-driven improvements
- **Feedback**: Fast and continuous feedback loops

---

## What is CI/CD

- **CI**: Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
- **CD**: Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
