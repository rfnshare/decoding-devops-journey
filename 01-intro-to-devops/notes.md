# üõ†Ô∏è Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development and IT operations teams.

- **Dev** = Software Development
- **Ops** = IT Operations
- Goal: Deliver applications and services at high velocity

---

## Key Benefits

- Faster time to market
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Increased deployment frequency
- Reduced failure rate of new releases
- Faster recovery time in case of failure

## Traditional vs DevOps Approach

| Aspect                | Traditional IT | DevOps               |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Development & Ops     | Siloed         | Collaborative        |
| Deployments           | Manual         | Automated (CI/CD)    |
| Feedback Cycle        | Slow           | Fast                 |
| Infrastructure Mgmt   | Manual setup   | IaC (e.g., Terraform)|
| Monitoring            | Reactive       | Proactive            |

## DevOps Lifecycle Phases

1. **Plan** ‚Äì Requirements and planning (Agile, Jira, etc.)
2. **Develop** ‚Äì Code development (Git, GitHub)
3. **Build** ‚Äì Compilation and build (Maven, Gradle)
4. **Test** ‚Äì Automated testing (JUnit, Selenium)
5. **Release** ‚Äì Versioning and approval
6. **Deploy** ‚Äì Automated deployment (CI/CD tools like Jenkins)
7. **Operate** ‚Äì Infrastructure and system administration (Docker, K8s)
8. **Monitor** ‚Äì Continuous feedback (Prometheus, ELK Stack)

---

## Core DevOps Tools (by Category)

- **Source Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- **Containers**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

---

## DevOps Culture

- **Collaboration**: Shared responsibilities between Dev and Ops
- **Automation**: Everything from testing to deployment
- **Measurement**: Metrics-driven improvements
- **Feedback**: Fast and continuous feedback loops

## üñ•Ô∏è Local VM Setup for DevOps Practice

### üîß Tools Used:
- **Vagrant** ‚Äì For VM automation
- **CentOS 7** ‚Äì RHEL-based Linux for server practice
- **Ubuntu (Jammy Jellyfish 22.04)** ‚Äì User-friendly Debian-based distro

---

### ‚úÖ VM Setup: CentOS 7 using Vagrant

```bash
# Create and enter project directory
mkdir centos-vm && cd centos-vm

# Initialize Vagrant with CentOS 7
vagrant init centos/7

# Start the VM
vagrant up

# SSH into the machine
vagrant ssh

# (Optional) Reload or halt
vagrant reload
vagrant halt

# Create and enter project directory
mkdir ubuntu-vm && cd ubuntu-vm

# Initialize with Ubuntu Jammy64
vagrant init generic/ubuntu2204

# Start and SSH
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
